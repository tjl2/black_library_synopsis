## Building a release runtime for AWS Lambda

1. Run the release and bootstrap tasks (_make sure you run this on an x86 machine_):

    ```shell
    MIX_ENV=production mix do release, bootstrap
    ```

2. Then you need to fix an issue in the `_build/production/rel/black_library_synopsis/bootstrap` script, which calls `foreground` instead of `start`:

    ```diff
    -    $EXE foreground
    +    $EXE start
    ```

3. Then you need to zip up the release:

    ```shell
    mix zip
    ```

    The output will be a file called `lambda.zip` in the root of the project.
